## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Why Phase 4 was skipped:**
- 3D constellation is designed for tech portfolios showing project relationships
- Not appropriate for artist portfolios where chronological display matters
- Would distract from the artwork itself

**Why Phase 5 was skipped:**
- AR viewing is only useful for 3D models/sculptures
- Paintings are inherently 2D - AR viewing provides no benefit

**Design Philosophy:**
- Focus on the artwork, not flashy tech
- Performance over features
- Accessibility is not optional
- SEO ensures the work gets seen

## 🎨 Brand Consistency

All implementations maintain the existing aesthetic:
- **Colors:** Black background (#111111), gold accents (#c2a385)
- **Typography:** Playfair Display (headings), Inter (body)
- **Style:** Elegant, gallery-like, professional
- **Focus:** Artwork-first presentation

No changes were made that compromise the existing design language.
