# Artwork Formatting Migration Script

This script fixes formatting and spacing issues in artwork titles throughout your Sanity CMS.

## What it fixes

- Removes spaces before commas (e.g., `"Canvas ,"` ‚Üí `"Canvas,"`)
- Ensures spaces after commas (e.g., `"Canvas,8x10"` ‚Üí `"Canvas, 8x10"`)
- Standardizes format: `"Medium on Surface, dimensions"`
