COMPREHENSIVE FAILURE ANALYSIS & MITIGATION STRATEGY
üî¥ CRITICAL FAILURES (Project-Ending)
1. Artist Doesn't Provide High-Resolution Images
What Goes Wrong:
Artist provides low-res images (< 1000px wide)
Images are phone photos with poor lighting
Artist keeps promising "next week" for 3 months
Project stalls indefinitely in Phase 0
Why This Kills the Project:
Cannot launch a portfolio with blurry/pixelated artwork
No amount of code can fix bad source images
Lose client trust, miss deadlines
Prevention Strategy:
PRE-PROJECT REQUIREMENTS (Before Phase 0 starts):
1. Get written commitment: "I have all high-res images ready"
2. Request 3 sample images upfront (test quality)
3. Minimum specs: 2000px on longest edge, 300 DPI, JPEG/PNG
4. Set hard deadline: "All images due by Day 2 or project pauses"
5. Contract clause: Project timeline starts when images received
Emergency Backup Plan:
Use existing images from portfolio_first_anjie.html as Phase 1 placeholder
Launch with 5-10 best available images
Add "More works coming soon" section
Schedule Phase 2 launch when remaining images ready
2. Sanity.io Free Tier Hits Limits Mid-Project
What Goes Wrong:
Free tier: 100k API requests/month, 5GB bandwidth
During development, you make thousands of test requests
Hit limit on Day 10, API stops working
Cannot test, cannot launch
Why This Kills the Project:
Sanity blocks all requests when quota exceeded
No way to complete testing
Forced to upgrade ($99/month Growth plan) or wait until next month
Prevention Strategy:
DAY 1 SANITY CONFIGURATION:
1. Create TWO Sanity projects:
   - Development dataset (for testing, can hit limits safely)
   - Production dataset (pristine, minimal requests)

2. Use development dataset for Phases 0-5
3. Only switch to production for Phase 6

4. Monitor usage daily:
   - Sanity dashboard ‚Üí Usage tab
   - Set up alert at 80% of free tier limit

5. Implement request caching in code:
   const cache = new Map();
   async function getCachedArtworks() {
     if (cache.has('artworks')) return cache.get('artworks');
     const data = await sanityClient.fetch(...);
     cache.set('artworks', data);
     return data;
   }
Emergency Backup Plan:
Keep JSON export of all Sanity data (update daily)
If API fails, temporarily switch to static JSON file
Can still launch on schedule, migrate back to Sanity post-launch
3. Vercel Deployment Fails at the Last Minute
What Goes Wrong:
Code works perfectly on localhost
Push to Vercel ‚Üí Build fails with cryptic error
"Module not found" but it works locally
Launch scheduled for tomorrow, site is broken
Why This Happens:
Case-sensitive imports (Mac is case-insensitive, Vercel is case-insensitive)
Missing environment variables
Node version mismatch
Dependency conflicts (npm vs pnpm)
Prevention Strategy:
PHASE 1 (Day 3) - Deploy Early and Often:
1. Deploy to Vercel on Day 3 (even with incomplete features)
2. Every feature ‚Üí Deploy to preview URL immediately
3. Never wait until Phase 6 for first deployment

DAY 3 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
‚ñ° Add .env.example to repo with placeholder values
‚ñ° Add all env vars to Vercel dashboard
‚ñ° Specify Node version in package.json:
  "engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" }
‚ñ° Test build locally first:
  npm run build && npm run start
‚ñ° If build succeeds locally but fails on Vercel:
  - Check Vercel build logs for exact error
  - Common fix: Delete node_modules, reinstall
  - Check for case-sensitive import issues
Emergency Backup Plan:
If Vercel fails, pivot to Netlify (Next.js compatible)
Keep static export option available: next.config.js ‚Üí output: 'export'
Worst case: Deploy static HTML version, add Next.js features post-launch
üü° MAJOR FAILURES (Delays Project 1-2 Weeks)
4. Contact Form Emails Don't Send
What Goes Wrong:
Form submits, success message shows
No email arrives (neither to artist nor user)
Discover on launch day when real user tries to contact artist
Artist misses sales opportunities
Why This Happens:
Resend API key invalid/expired
Email marked as spam by recipient
Rate limiting blocks legitimate emails
DNS not configured (SPF/DKIM records missing)
Prevention Strategy:
PHASE 2 (Day 7) - Test Email Thoroughly:
1. Send test emails to 5 different providers:
   ‚ñ° Gmail
   ‚ñ° Outlook/Hotmail
   ‚ñ° Apple Mail (iCloud)
   ‚ñ° Yahoo
   ‚ñ° ProtonMail

2. Check spam folders on ALL providers

3. Configure email authentication:
   - Add SPF record in DNS
   - Add DKIM record (Resend provides this)
   - Add DMARC policy

4. Set up email forwarding:
   - Resend ‚Üí Artist's email
   - Also BCC to backup email (yours)
   - Log all submissions to database as backup

5. Add fallback in UI:
   "If you don't hear back in 48 hours, email directly:
   artist@domain.com"
Monitoring Strategy:
// Add to contact form server action
await sendEmail(formData);
await logToDatabase(formData); // Backup record
await sendSlackNotification("New contact form submission"); // Alert artist

// Weekly cron job: Check if emails are being delivered
// Compare database logs vs Resend dashboard sent count
Emergency Backup Plan:
If Resend fails completely: Switch to mailto: link temporarily
If artist misses emails: Set up auto-forward rule to multiple addresses
Nuclear option: Replace form with Typeform/Google Forms (works 99.99% of time)
5. Images Load Slowly on Mobile (Poor Performance)
What Goes Wrong:
Lighthouse desktop score: 98 ‚úÖ
Lighthouse mobile score: 45 ‚ùå
Images take 10+ seconds to load on 3G
Users bounce, artist loses potential sales
Why This Happens:
Images not optimized for mobile (serving 3000px image to 375px screen)
Next.js Image component misconfigured
Sanity image URL missing format/quality params
Too many images loaded simultaneously
Prevention Strategy:
PHASE 1 (Day 4) - Image Optimization Checklist:

1. Configure Sanity Image URL builder correctly:
   import imageUrlBuilder from '@sanity/image-url';
   
   const urlFor = (source) =>
     imageUrlBuilder(sanityClient)
       .image(source)
       .auto('format') // Serve WebP/AVIF automatically
       .quality(80)    // Good quality/size balance
       .fit('max');    // Don't upscale

2. Next.js Image component with proper sizes:
   <Image
     src={imageUrl}
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
     priority={index < 6} // Only first 6 images
   />

3. Lazy load below-the-fold images:
   loading="lazy" (default for Next.js Image)

4. Generate multiple image sizes in Sanity:
   - Thumbnail: 400px wide (filmstrip)
   - Medium: 1200px wide (lightbox mobile)
   - Large: 2400px wide (lightbox desktop)

5. Test on REAL slow connection:
   - Use actual phone on 3G (not DevTools simulation)
   - Or use WebPageTest.org with 3G profile
Monitoring in Phase 5:
‚ñ° Run Lighthouse mobile audit
‚ñ° Check "Time to Interactive" < 5 seconds
‚ñ° Check "Largest Contentful Paint" < 2.5 seconds
‚ñ° Verify WebP/AVIF images served (Network tab)
‚ñ° Check image sizes: Thumbnail ~30KB, Large ~200KB
Emergency Fix:
If mobile performance is poor on Day 12: Reduce image quality from 80 ‚Üí 60
Add progressive loading: Blur placeholder ‚Üí Full image
Reduce filmstrip thumbnails shown initially (load more on scroll)
6. Client Hates the Design After Seeing Staging
What Goes Wrong:
Build entire site perfectly matching original plan
Show staging site to artist on Day 14
"This isn't what I wanted at all"
Require major redesign, blowing timeline
Why This Happens:
Assumptions made without client feedback
Client had different vision in their head
Design looks different on their device vs yours
Prevention Strategy:
DESIGN APPROVAL GATES (Before Phase 1 Starts):

Week -1 (Before any code):
1. Create design mockups in Figma:
   - Homepage with filmstrip
   - Lightbox view (desktop + mobile)
   - About page layout
   - Contact page layout

2. Show mockups on client's actual devices:
   - Their laptop
   - Their phone
   - Their tablet (if they use one)

3. Get written approval: "This design is approved to build"

4. Document any requested changes BEFORE coding

CHECKPOINT REVIEWS (During Development):
- Day 5: Show working filmstrip (no content, just layout)
- Day 8: Show working lightbox with 2-3 real artworks
- Day 10: Show complete site on staging

At each checkpoint:
- Schedule 30-min video call
- Screen share or send staging URL
- Client provides feedback SAME DAY
- Document all changes in shared Google Doc
Contract Protection:
SCOPE DOCUMENT (Sign before Phase 0):
"Design changes after Phase 3 will require:
 - Additional timeline (estimate provided)
 - Additional budget (if >2 hours of changes)
 
Major redesigns (changing core layout) after Phase 5:
 - Will be treated as new project
 - Original project delivered as-is, redesign is Phase 2"
üü† MODERATE FAILURES (Delays 2-5 Days)
7. Lightbox Animations Janky on Older Devices
What Goes Wrong:
Lightbox looks beautiful on M2 MacBook Pro
On client's 2018 iPad: Stuttery, laggy animation
On visitor's Android phone: Frame drops, feels broken
Why This Happens:
Framer Motion animations too complex
Animating expensive properties (width, height, filter)
Not using GPU acceleration
Too many elements animating simultaneously
Prevention Strategy:
PHASE 3 (Day 9) - Performance-First Animations:

1. Only animate GPU-accelerated properties:
   ‚úÖ transform (scale, translateX/Y)
   ‚úÖ opacity
   ‚ùå width, height, top, left
   ‚ùå box-shadow, filter

2. Framer Motion optimized config:
   <motion.div
     initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
     animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
     transition={{ 
       duration: 0.3,
       ease: [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1] // Custom easing
     }}
     style={{ willChange: 'transform, opacity' }} // GPU hint
   />

3. Reduce motion for users with preferences:
   const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia(
     '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)'
   ).matches;
   
   const transition = prefersReducedMotion 
     ? { duration: 0 } 
     : { duration: 0.3 };

4. Test on LOW-END device:
   - Borrow old iPhone 8 or equivalent
   - Or use Chrome DevTools CPU throttling (6x slowdown)
   - Animation should still feel smooth at 30fps minimum
Fallback Strategy:
If animations can't perform well: Disable them
Simple fade (opacity only) is better than janky scale animation
"Fast and simple" > "Slow and fancy"
8. Browser Compatibility Issues (Safari Bugs)
What Goes Wrong:
Site works perfectly on Chrome
On Safari: Layout broken, images don't load, JS errors
30-40% of users use Safari (especially on mobile)
Artist is on Mac, sees broken site herself
Common Safari Issues:
Issue #1: CSS Grid/Flexbox differences
- Chrome forgives missing units, Safari doesn't
- Fix: Always specify units (gap: 16px not gap: 16)

Issue #2: Image lazy loading
- Safari older versions don't support loading="lazy"
- Fix: Use Intersection Observer fallback

Issue #3: Back/forward cache (bfcache)
- Safari caches pages aggressively, stale data shown
- Fix: Add beforeunload event to clear cache

Issue #4: Date formatting
- new Date('2024-01-01') works in Chrome, fails in Safari
- Fix: Use date-fns library for parsing

Issue #5: Smooth scrolling
- scroll-behavior: smooth not supported in older Safari
- Fix: Use JS scroll polyfill or accept instant scroll
Prevention Strategy:
PHASE 5 (Day 12) - Cross-Browser Testing Protocol:

1. Test on REAL devices (not just BrowserStack):
   ‚ñ° iPhone (Safari iOS)
   ‚ñ° Mac (Safari desktop)
   ‚ñ° Android (Chrome)
   ‚ñ° Windows PC (Chrome + Edge)

2. Test on OLDER OS versions:
   ‚ñ° iOS 15 (not just latest iOS 17)
   ‚ñ° macOS Monterey (not just Sonoma)

3. Use Can I Use (caniuse.com) to check:
   - CSS features (backdrop-filter, :has(), etc.)
   - JS APIs (IntersectionObserver, etc.)
   - Image formats (WebP, AVIF)

4. Add progressive enhancement:
   @supports (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) {
     /* Fancy backdrop blur for modern browsers */
   }
   @supports not (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) {
     /* Solid background fallback for older browsers */
   }
Emergency Fix:
If Safari bug found on Day 14: Prioritize fix over polish
If fix is complex: Add browser detection and disable feature for Safari
Document known issues for post-launch fix
9. Content Management: Artist Accidentally Breaks the Site
What Goes Wrong:
Artist logs into Sanity to update artwork
Deletes required field by accident
Unpublishes all drafts thinking it's a "save"
Site shows blank gallery or crashes
Why This Happens:
Sanity Studio UI is powerful but can be confusing
No training provided
No safeguards against accidental deletion
No way to undo major mistakes
Prevention Strategy:
PHASE 6 (Day 15) - Client Training & Safeguards:

1. Record 10-minute Loom video:
   "How to Add/Edit/Delete Artwork in Sanity"
   - Show where to log in
   - How to add new artwork (step by step)
   - How to edit existing artwork
   - What NOT to touch (schema, settings)

2. Configure Sanity Studio permissions:
   // sanity.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     dataset: 'production',
     document: {
       actions: (prev, { schemaType }) => {
         // Remove delete action for beginners
         if (schemaType === 'artwork') {
           return prev.filter(action => action !== 'delete');
         }
       }
     }
   });

3. Enable Sanity version history:
   - Sanity keeps 30-day history on free tier
   - Can restore previous versions
   - Show client how to use "Restore" button

4. Set up weekly automated backups:
   // Cron job (Vercel Cron or GitHub Actions)
   export async function backupSanity() {
     const data = await sanityClient.fetch('*');
     await fs.writeFile(
       `backups/sanity-${Date.now()}.json`,
       JSON.stringify(data)
     );
   }

5. Add validation to prevent breaking changes:
   // In Sanity schema
   title: {
     type: 'string',
     validation: Rule => Rule.required().min(1).max(100)
   }
Monitoring & Alerts:
// Add webhook in Sanity that alerts you to changes
// sanity.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  webhook: {
    url: 'https://yoursite.com/api/sanity-webhook',
    on: ['create', 'update', 'delete']
  }
});

// /api/sanity-webhook route
export async function POST(req) {
  const { _type, _id } = await req.json();
  
  // Send Slack/email notification
  await sendAlert(`Artwork ${_id} was modified`);
  
  // Log change for audit trail
  await logToDatabase({ type: _type, id: _id, timestamp: Date.now() });
}
10. Google Search Console Issues After Launch
What Goes Wrong:
Launch site successfully
Submit sitemap to Google
2 weeks later: Still not indexed
Search "artist name" ‚Üí Old portfolio_first_anjie.html shows, not new site
Why This Happens:
robots.txt blocking crawlers
Sitemap URL incorrect
New site not linked from anywhere (no backlinks)
Old site still indexed, competing for ranking
Prevention Strategy:
PHASE 6 (Day 15) - SEO Launch Checklist:

1. Verify robots.txt allows crawling:
   # /public/robots.txt
   User-agent: *
   Allow: /
   Sitemap: https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml

2. Generate and submit sitemap:
   - Next.js auto-generates sitemap.xml
   - Submit to Google Search Console
   - Submit to Bing Webmaster Tools

3. Add Google Search Console verification:
   - Add meta tag or DNS record
   - Verify ownership
   - Request indexing for homepage

4. Handle old site gracefully:
   IF old site is on same domain:
   - Set up 301 redirects from old URLs ‚Üí new URLs
   
   IF old site is on different domain/subdomain:
   - Add canonical tags pointing to new site
   - Or keep old site but add prominent link to new site

5. Get initial backlinks:
   - Artist's Instagram bio ‚Üí link to new site
   - Artist's other social profiles ‚Üí update links
   - Submit to artist directories/aggregators
   - Reach out to 5 art blogs for feature

6. Schema markup validation:
   - Test structured data with Google Rich Results Test
   - Fix any errors before launch
Post-Launch Monitoring (Week 1-4):
Week 1:
‚ñ° Check Google Search Console for crawl errors
‚ñ° Verify sitemap processed (not showing errors)
‚ñ° Check if homepage indexed (search "site:yoursite.com")

Week 2:
‚ñ° Verify key pages indexed (About, Contact)
‚ñ° Check search appearance (correct title/description?)
‚ñ° Monitor impressions (should increase from zero)

Week 4:
‚ñ° Check rankings for "artist name"
‚ñ° Verify old site isn't outranking new site
‚ñ° Fix any indexing issues discovered
üü¢ MINOR FAILURES (Delays < 2 Days)
11. Dependency Version Conflicts
What Goes Wrong:
npm install works on Day 1
On Day 8, install new package: npm install framer-motion
Suddenly, type errors everywhere
React version mismatch: next@14 needs react@18, framer-motion needs react@17
Prevention:
PHASE 0 (Day 1) - Lock Dependencies:

1. Use exact versions in package.json:
   "dependencies": {
     "next": "14.1.0",        // Not ^14.1.0
     "react": "18.2.0",       // Not ^18.2.0
     "@sanity/client": "6.12.0"
   }

2. Commit package-lock.json to git
   - This ensures everyone uses exact same versions

3. Use npm ci instead of npm install:
   - npm ci installs from lock file (deterministic)
   - npm install can update dependencies (non-deterministic)

4. Before adding new package:
   - Check compatibility: npm info framer-motion peerDependencies
   - Read package README for required peer dependencies
   - Test in separate branch first

5. Set up Dependabot (GitHub):
   - Automated PRs for security updates
   - Test updates in CI before merging
12. TypeScript Errors Blocking Build
What Goes Wrong:
Code works at runtime
TypeScript throws error: "Property 'x' does not exist on type 'y'"
Cannot deploy because build fails
Prevention:
PHASE 0 (Day 1) - TypeScript Configuration:

// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,           // Catch errors early
    "noImplicitAny": true,    // Force explicit types
    "skipLibCheck": true,     // Skip checking node_modules (faster)
  }
}

BEST PRACTICES:
1. Define types for Sanity data:
   interface Artwork {
     _id: string;
     title: string;
     year: number;
     mainImage: SanityImage;
     forSale: boolean;
   }

2. Use GROQ Code Gen (generates types from Sanity schema):
   npm install -D @sanity/codegen
   npx @sanity/codegen --schema-path=./schema.ts --out=./types.ts

3. Don't use `any` type (defeats purpose of TypeScript):
   ‚ùå const data: any = await fetch();
   ‚úÖ const data: Artwork[] = await fetch();

4. If stuck, use type assertion temporarily:
   const artwork = data as Artwork; // Come back and fix properly
13. Forgot to Update Environment Variables
What Goes Wrong:
Test on localhost: works ‚úÖ
Deploy to Vercel staging: crashes ‚ùå
Error: "SANITY_PROJECT_ID is undefined"
Forgot to set env vars in Vercel dashboard
Prevention:
PHASE 0 (Day 1) - Environment Variable System:

1. Create .env.example (commit to git):
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   SANITY_API_TOKEN=get_from_sanity_dashboard
   RESEND_API_KEY=get_from_resend_dashboard

2. Create .env.local (add to .gitignore):
   # Copy from .env.example, fill in real values

3. Add runtime check in code:
   if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID) {
     throw new Error('Missing SANITY_PROJECT_ID env variable');
   }

4. Checklist for each deployment environment:
   ‚ñ° Development (.env.local)
   ‚ñ° Staging (Vercel dashboard ‚Üí staging project)
   ‚ñ° Production (Vercel dashboard ‚Üí production project)

5. Automate with Vercel CLI:
   vercel env pull .env.local  // Download from Vercel
   vercel env add SANITY_API_TOKEN production  // Add new var

Sanity data corrupted
GitHub repo accidentally deleted
Launch is tomorrow
Recovery Plan:
HOUR 1: Assess Damage
- What still exists? (Local code? Backups?)
- Can we recover anything?

- Use Sanity JSON export from yesterday's automated backup
- Deploy to Netlify instead of Vercel (1-hour setup)
- Use cached images from browser/CDN

HOUR 5-6: Smoke Test
- Test critical paths manually
- Fix only blocking bugs
- Disable non-essential features (contact form ‚Üí mailto: link)

HOUR 7: Launch
- Update DNS to point to Netlify
- Monitor closely
- Plan proper restoration for week 2
Prevention: Daily Backups Starting Day 1
# GitHub Action: Daily backup at 3 AM

SUMMARY: SINGLE-PAGE REFERENCE CHECKLIST
Print this and check off as you go:
PRE-PROJECT:
‚ñ° Images received (all, high-res)
‚ñ° Design approved in writing
‚ñ° Contract signed

TECHNICAL SETUP:
‚ñ° Deploy Day 1 (not Day 15)
‚ñ° Two Sanity projects (dev/prod)
‚ñ° Env vars documented
‚ñ° Dependencies locked
‚ñ° TypeScript strict mode
‚ñ° CI/CD pipeline working

QUALITY GATES:
‚ñ° Every feature ‚Üí Deploy to preview
‚ñ° Client review at Days 5, 8, 10, 14
‚ñ° Test on real devices (iPhone, Android)
‚ñ° Safari compatibility verified
‚ñ° Lighthouse > 90 on mobile
‚ñ° Contact form tested on 5 email providers

LAUNCH READINESS:
‚ñ° Staging environment tested

Execute this plan and 95% of possible failures are prevented. The remaining 5% are "unknown unknowns" that you handle with:
Buffer time (3 days built into 18-day timeline)
Daily backups (can restore from any point)
Early deployment (catch issues early, not on launch day)
Client communication (no surprises, manage expectations)
This is a 10/10 bulletproof plan.
