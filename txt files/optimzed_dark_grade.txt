 Overall Score: 4/10

  Visual Design (3/10)

  - Dark theme with overlays is trendy but executed poorly - the
  double gradient (top + bottom) creates muddy visual depth
  - The filter: brightness(0.85) contrast(1.1) (line 47)
  arbitrarily degrades image quality for no good reason
  - Black background (#000) is harsh on the eyes - no
  consideration for true dark mode best practices
  - The zoom effect on transition (scale(1.08)) is a clich√© 2015
  Medium article effect

  Typography (5/10)

  - Archivo is a decent font choice
  - Letter spacing is inconsistent: -0.03em for headers, 0.1em for
   nav (lines 98, 111) - no clear typographic system
  - 4rem title (line 146) is absurdly large on smaller screens
  with no responsive scaling
  - The uppercase everything approach (lines 98, 112, 151, 198) is
   visually exhausting and reduces readability
  - Line height of 0.95 (line 148) is illegibly tight

  Layout & Spacing (4/10)

  - Fixed positioning everywhere creates a rigid, inflexible
  layout
  - 3.5rem padding is arbitrary - not based on any grid system
  - 60% max-width on title (line 142) means on wide screens you
  waste 40% of premium real estate
  - Thumbnail grid is fixed at 6 columns (line 229) with no logic
  for different screen sizes
  - Bottom UI elements (year filter + thumbnails) will collide on
  medium-width screens

  Navigation/Interaction (3/10)

  - Critical flaw: Hover zones are 35% of screen width (line 270)
  - massive dead zones for clicking
  - Navigation arrows only appear on hover - terrible
  discoverability, violates basic UX principles
  - The navigation links (Work, About, Contact) don't actually go
  anywhere (href="#") - literally non-functional
  - Clicking thumbnails works, but they're tiny (70px) with
  minimal touch target size
  - Progress bar at top (line 323) is almost invisible at 2px
  height

  Accessibility (1/10)

  - No ARIA labels anywhere
  - No keyboard focus indicators (explicitly removed on lines
  205-209) - completely breaks keyboard navigation
  - No alt text for images - screen readers get nothing
  - Insufficient color contrast - rgba(255,255,255,0.6) on nav
  links likely fails WCAG AA
  - No skip links or semantic HTML structure
  - Removed focus outlines - hostile to keyboard users
  - Cursor changes (w-resize, e-resize on lines 277, 282) are
  semantically incorrect

  Responsive Design (2/10)

  - overflow: hidden on body (line 24) with fixed heights -
  guaranteed to break on mobile
  - Zero media queries - this will be catastrophic on phones
  - Fixed pixel values everywhere: 70px thumbnails, 4rem titles,
  3.5rem padding
  - 6-column thumbnail grid will be microscopic on mobile
  - Hover interactions are completely useless on touch devices

  Performance (6/10)

  - Preloading all images (lines 423-426) is good
  - But loading from Unsplash with q=80&w=2000 for every image is
  bandwidth-heavy
  - No lazy loading for thumbnails
  - Multiple Google Fonts weights (400, 600, 900) when you could
  subset
  - No image format optimization (WebP, AVIF)
  - Backdrop-filter (line 300) is expensive on mobile GPUs

  User Experience Flow (4/10)

  - Auto-playing portfolio galleries are annoying - user has no
  control
  - Year filtering is decent but buttons have no visual separation
   (gap: 0 on line 186)
  - Active states on year filter are subtle
  - No indication of total number of images
  - No way to pause/stop the interaction
  - Clicking on large hover zones instead of clear buttons is
  unintuitive

  Content Strategy (5/10)

  - Artist name and work titles are good
  - Metadata (year + medium) is useful
  - But the navigation links are fake (#) which is unprofessional
  - No actual content - just placeholder Unsplash images
  - No about/bio, no project descriptions beyond title

  Technical Implementation (5/10)

  - Clean vanilla JS, no framework bloat (good)
  - But the isTransitioning flag (line 409) is a crude debounce
  - Hardcoded gallery array instead of API/CMS integration
  - Magic number timeouts (1000ms, 300ms) scattered throughout
  - No error handling for failed image loads
  - data:, favicon (line 8) is lazy

  ---
  Fatal Flaws:

  1. Completely unusable on mobile - no responsive design
  whatsoever
  2. Accessibility nightmare - actively hostile to keyboard/screen
   reader users
  3. Fake navigation - links go nowhere
  4. Poor interaction design - hidden controls, massive hover
  zones

  What It Does Right:

  - Preloads images
  - Smooth transitions
  - Year filtering works
  - Clean code structure

  This feels like a Dribbble shot made real without considering
  actual users. It prioritizes aesthetics over usability and
  completely ignores mobile, accessibility, and real-world usage
  patterns. Would not pass any serious design review.
