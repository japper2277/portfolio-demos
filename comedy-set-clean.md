# Jared's Comedy Set

## OPENING / SELF-IDENTITY

**Weird, Awkward, Unique**
- I've been called "unique" so much, now it's a diss. Like someone leaves: "See you later!" "So um, what did you guys think of Jared?" "He's... different?"
- I get it! I get it! I'm a weird little man, honk honk! Spank me like one of your elves, Santa!

**Birthday Party Bit**
- I have a lot of friends... who all think they're my only friend.
- Every birthday party is a HUGE surprise... for them.
- "Holy shit Jared, you have THIS many... you have 10 friends?! Then why am I here? I came here out of pity... I wouldn't have came if I knew I wasn't your only friend..."
- *(look around)* "Wait, what the... does that person have breasts... what... James Bond over here..."
- "Why did I go? I didn't have to go anymore!"
- It's the only birthday party where you walk in, see music playing, people dancing, and you're like "No way this is the place. This can't be the place..."

**Self-Awareness**
- I thought I was self-conscious, but that implies a sense of self, which I don't have... Every time I try to look in the mirror, all I see is the moldy bathtub behind me.
- I don't have Oedipus complex... I don't wanna date my mother, but who I wish my mother was... KIND, kind, nice to me.

## AGE 31 / POTENTIAL

**Being 31**
- I'm 31 years old and everyone around me is younger than me, and not by design. It's just the stage I am in life. I have the credentials of a 17-year-old teen woman because those are all my colleagues at my job I did over the summer as a camp counselor. The job you did when you were 14 years old? I'm 31.
- It's not cute anymore. It's real.
- How much longer can I call myself a boy genius? How much longer can I say I have potential?

**White Trash / Potential**
- I'm white trash. I wasn't always white trash. I used to have potential. And what is potential? It's hope for the future.
- Haven't accomplished anything yet, but I'm close.
- Feel like everything is a step away. Turns out just a step off a fucking cliff.

**This Is What Following Your Dreams Looks Like**
- *(to audience)* "I'm 31."
- Sister: "What have you been doing all these years?"
- "Following my dreams."

**The Cost**
- Started from the top, now we're here.
- The cost of following my dreams was my white privilege. Making 70k. I have enough privilege to make 70k, and I pissed it all away on making you guys—vast majority I don't like, I wouldn't be friends with 99% of you... I don't like you, yet live for your approval...

## DATING & RELATIONSHIPS

**Mom Funds Dating Life**
- Mom funds dating life. Funds, not invests, cuz no ROI.

**Dating White Guys**
- Every girl I date always says "I like white guys." Can't you just like me for me? But no, I'm relegated to a fetish.
- Which is just a humble way of me saying I date Puerto Ricans.
- Not white girls. Cuz white girls, of course they like white guys—who doesn't?—but they can't say it. Can't have your white boyfriend be like, "I love white men."
- I'm exotic. No one in Asia looks like me.

**I Don't Date for Love**
- I don't date for love or sex anymore. I date for touch. I date to be squeezed. Squeezer or squeezed...
- Like, you ever give a hug as a joke but you need it...

**Found a Woman!**
- Through years, decades, watching thousands of pickup videos on how to find a woman, I did! I did it!
- I found a woman that likes me.

**Like Back / Can't I Use Her for Validation**
- "I thought if she likes you, and she's hot, you just like her back... I didn't know you have a choice."
- "Can't I just use her for validation? So many girls did that to me... could I have ONE!!!"

**V / Like Back**
- Listen, I'm not gonna break up with you cuz you're a little older...
- I'm gonna break up with you! Cuz you love me back.
- That's no fun. I won! I beat the game.
- There's nothing worth fighting for anymore. You know what I mean?
- You're 18 years old. Just defeated Hitler. How do you follow that up?
- That's a lot of pressure! Best debut since Illmatic.
- How do you follow up Illmatic... Nas's debut. Nas dropped Illmatic at 19. Now what?
- Losing my V, that was Illmatic.
- I loved her... until she loved me back.
- You don't lose V, you lose your keys... I didn't lose my V, I shot it in its face. I slit its throat.
- I've been in a war for first 30 years of my life.
- *(military voice)* "We need more button downs!!!! I repeat, more V-neck button downs!!!"
- *(radio crackle)* "She said she doesn't feel a spark."
- "We need backup!!!! Call in _____"
- She was a one-hit wonder. Hit it once, no more wonder.

**Hide and Go Seek**
- I don't want you to get to know me. I do want you to try... I call it a hide-and-go-seek personality.
- I want you to try to love me. Don't actually do it.

**Horror Movie POV**
- You're on a date. Watching yourself from a third-person POV. Going well.
- "What are you doing?"
- Like going to a horror movie. Seeing people go to creepy house. "What are they doing?"

**Italian Girl From Long Island / HJ**
- His puppet master? Italian girls from Long Island.
- HJ, turns out... also password to my heart.
- Turns out if you give me an HJ, you can emotionally abuse me.
- Cuz one month and no HJs later, more double texts from ya boy than HJs.
- Turns out, you don't need surgery to not be a man... You just need a 4'9" Italian from Long Island not texting back.

**Couldn't Take Off Her Bra**
- Went into Victoria's Secret, bought a training bra.
- Not an actual training bra—a bra to train on.
- *(miming)* "Unclick, click, unclick, click."

**Menu Anxiety**
- "$100 you spent on guacamole... aka half my net worth."
- "When I look at a menu, all I see is percent signs."
- "The menu, a woman's greatest weapon."
- The entire "tracking her eye movement" bit: "Oh fuck, her eyes just moved to the top of the page. She wants appetizers!"
- "Couldn't afford salad. So I ate my credit. Gotta eat fiber. Worth less than the salad."
- "Next time... 'tap water please.'... Not only do I save money, I'm also a leader."

**Virgin Material**
- Bought a box of condoms—expected to lose my virginity a few times that day.
- Remember the first that, ya know, did, ya know, the initials unboxing...
